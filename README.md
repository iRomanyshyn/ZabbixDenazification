# Customizing Zabbix Branding and Icons in Nginx

Since the beginning of the russian invasion of Ukraine, the simple letter "Z" has become a symbol of pain, blood, torture, and a new form of Nazism, disguised under the pretense of "liberation" of a peaceful people and a peaceful country from something unknown â€” perhaps from life itself, or at least from peace. This guide has been created precisely for this reason: although the developers of Zabbix are not primarily russians, some among them likely promote their unwelcome perspectives. I don't want people to see my screen somewhere in public and think I am a ru-nazi supporter so I prefer to change the icon. 

Follow the steps outlined below to replace Zabbix's default icons and branding elements. This method utilizes Nginx configuration and custom icon files. This manual assumes the person has some experience with Linux and Nginx configuration.

This method worked on 5.4, is still effective on Zabbix version 6.4, and has not been tested on version 7.

## Nginx Configuration

In the Nginx configuration for Zabbix, under the relevant `server` section, add the following lines to handle the custom icons:

```nginx
location = /favicon.ico {
    log_not_found   off;
    alias /usr/share/zabbix/branding/custom-icons/favicon.ico;
    expires max;
}
location ~* /assets/img/apple-touch-icon-(76x76|120x120|152x152|180x180)-precomposed\.png {
    alias /usr/share/zabbix/branding/custom-icons/apple-touch-icon-$1-precomposed.png;
    expires max;
}
location ~* /assets/img/touch-icon-192x192\.png {
    alias /usr/share/zabbix/branding/custom-icons/touch-icon-192x192.png;
    expires max;
}
```
Usually, the configuration file can be found somewhere in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`. In Ubuntu, it is a link `/etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf -> /etc/zabbix/nginx.conf`.
After changing the config file, run `sudo systemctl reload nginx.service` to reload the configuration into Nginx.

Note: If the `favicon.ico` is already referenced elsewhere in the Nginx configuration, update that existing line rather than adding a new one as multiple references to the same path may break the configuration.

## Creating Icons

You can generate the necessary icon files using ImageMagick or GIMP. These custom icons should be stored in the `/usr/share/zabbix/branding/custom-icons/` directory.

```
- favicon.ico
- apple-touch-icon-76x76-precomposed.png
- apple-touch-icon-120x120-precomposed.png
- apple-touch-icon-152x152-precomposed.png
- apple-touch-icon-180x180-precomposed.png
- touch-icon-192x192.png
```

## Custom Branding

To further customize Zabbix's appearance, you can modify the branding using a hidden feature that is not mentioned in the official manuals anymore. This can be done by creating or editing the following file:

**Path:** `/usr/share/zabbix/local/conf/brand.conf.php`

### Full File Example:

```php
<?php
return [
    'BRAND_LOGO' => '/branding/custom-logo.png',
    'BRAND_LOGO_SIDEBAR' => '/branding/custom-sidebar-logo.png',
    'BRAND_LOGO_SIDEBAR_COMPACT' => '/branding/custom-sidebar-logo-compact.png',
    'BRAND_FOOTER' => 'CompanyName - Monitoring '.ZABBIX_VERSION
];
```

### Logo Sizes:

- Main logo: 114x30
- Sidebar logo: 91x24
- Compact sidebar logo: 24x24

**Important:** The branding feature is somewhat hidden, and the official documentation does not mention it anymore. Some links that previously led to details about this feature now return a 404 error.
